A Presentation and Brief Explanation of Conway's Game of Life
Kyle Neubarth, CSCI 1300 Assignment 8


_IMPORTANT_
Patterns are broken right now! They are not printing correctly, I am currently working on the problem but if it has not been fixed, email me at kyne7959@colorado.edu. Broken patterns means:
-when I print set patterns, they are distorted and do not look correct
-simulations where I paste set patterns will not work correctly
Program will still run!

structure of presentation:
-intro, run the simulation until it reaches ground state, it looks cool.
-explanation, introduce the project and explain the rules of the algorithm
-interaction, run a simulation, let user increment frames at their own speed so they can see the rules in action
*explaining patterns
-still lifes, talk about how Life reaches a ground state or stable patterns, print list of still lifes
-oscilators, talk about the oscilator patterns, list them
-flying machines, run a simulation with a glider! Explain flying machines and list them
*wrap up

Classes:

LifeAlgorithm:
holds a grid of bools that represent cells
Can execute rules on itself(DoTick)
Can seed itself with random value
Basically is the algorithm that other classes interact with

PatternSpotter:
-Disclaimer no longer spots patterns-
holds an array of pattern objects, read from a file.
can print a pattern onto the console
can paste a pattern onto a grid (LifeAlgorithm.grid)

Pattern:
simply a pattern, max size of 10x10
has a 2d array of bool, width of pattern, and height
